### Hello!

            My name is Eduardo Lopes. I'm an Emergency and ICU pediatrician, seeking a career change to computer programming. I have started with computing in 1987, with ZX81 Basic and Z80 Assembly. Nowadays I'm an OpenBSD user, in my daily driver laptop, teaching myself some computing.
